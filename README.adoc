= Hybrid Cloud Quarkus/CockroachDB/Skupper

This demo deploys a Quarkus TODO app in an hybrid cloud using Skupper and Kubernetes/OpenShift.
The database used is CockroachDB as it is a database that fits perfectly the needs of replication information across different clusters.

== Preparing

Rename the `.env.example` to `.env` and fill with the information required to access to your clusters.

== 2 backends (1 in each cluster) & 1 DB (primary cluster)
